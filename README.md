# Deep Learning Project Template

This is a template for Deep Learning (maybe other projects are also fine).

## Usage

Just clone this project to your directory and change the project name `Template` to your project name `ProjectName` and fill your code in corresponding file. 

## Highlight

`utils.utils.log_info` can help record information to both terminal and logfile.

`configs.cfg` accept arguments from terminal and arrange configurations as attributes of an object `cfg`.
